                    Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent 
                    that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial 
                    facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include 
                    particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution 
                    cause respiratory and other diseases and is an important source of morbidity and mortality (World Health Organization)  </p>

                <h2> Fatalities by Air pollution category </h2>
                 <p class="text">
                    Exposure to high levels of air pollution can cause a variety of adverse health outcomes. 
                    It increases the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer.  Both short and long term exposure 
                    to air pollutants have been associated with health impacts. Air pollution kills an estimated seven million 
                    people worldwide every year. This layered bar chart shows that indoor air pollution is the most deadly as particles
                    are concentrated in a specific area. Particulate matter is the major reason as to why air pollution is so deadly, with ozone
                    pollution contributing to a lower amount.</p>

                <h2> Effects of air pollution globally </h2>
                <p class="text"> Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year. WHO data shows that almost all of the 
                    global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits containing high levels of pollutants, with 
                    low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. The map below shows the number of deaths (normalised 
                    per 100k population) of each country from years 1990 to 2017. As can be observed from the map, some countries are very much
                    affected by air pollution as compared to others and this depends on a number of factors.

                <h2> Air Quality </h2>
                <p class="text"> The major factor that causes this difference in different countries is the Air quality in their country. The map
                    below shows the air quality by observing the Particulate Matter 2.5 concentration (micrograms per cubic meter) in each country 
                    from years 2010 to 2017. As can be observed, there is a direct relation in the 2 maps as the PM 2.5 concentration has a direct 
                    impact on deaths on the respective population.

            <div  class="pure-u-1-2"> <p class="text"> It is worth to note however that the trend in fatality (per 100k population) is decreasing every year.
                It is proof that our air quality is getting better. This is especially true for the indoor pollution which is a major
                part of the causes of death globally as can be observed from the multi-line series. 
                It is also worth to note that during covid lockdowns, as industrial activities
                were slowed down, air quality has drastically improved worldwide and thus reduces air pollution globally.</p>  </div>
